I was born in the Andromeda galaxy, not sure which planet. I flew to Earth in a ship with a Capuchine monkey as my only companion.

When I arrived, I researched the best city in which to dwell. I chose Northampton, MA. It is a lovely small city in the western part of the state. I was able to secure a position fairly quickly at the NPR station in Deerfield, WNNZ-fm. My title is Reporter for the Outer Banks of the Universe. Pretty apt, eh?

My first project consisted of searching media publications for mention of beings from that region. Of course, I found multiple articles. The next step was the most difficult: finding those individuals. I looked through the relevant location resources and picked 12 locals that I would interview. I called them the Pseudonymous Dozen, because I didn't want them exposed to public scrutiny.

Their names were... Come on, heh heh, you didn't think I would reveal them, did you?
